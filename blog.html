            Que:1-Discuss the scope of var, let, and const?
        </div>
        <div class="collapse-content"> 
          <p>Ans:  <span class="text-[#245481] font-[700]">Var</span>-Var follows global scope. It doesn't follow block scope, so we call var anywhere in the scope.We call it in the function , but it doesn't follow the condition all time, sometime var skip some condition.So, we can't get the desire result all time using var.<br><br>
            <span class="text-[#245481] font-[700]">Let, Const</span>-Let & const follow block scope. It doesn't follow golbal scope. So when we call it in the function or block scope, it doesn't work global or outside scope.Let and Const fulfil/execute all the condition of function. So, we find the desire result of a function using let and const.

            Que:2-Tell us the use cases of null and undefined?
        </div>
        <div class="collapse-content"> 
          <p>Ans: <span class="text-[#245481] font-[700]">null-</span></p> 1.When we see there is no value of the element we using null value of the element.<br>
           2.typeof null is an object, so we use it as a object placeholder.<br>
           3.We also use null as a return value of a fuction, if the function doesn't have a meaningful result.<br><br>
           <span class="text-[#245481] font-[700]">Undefined-</span></p>
           1.If we don't put any values of the element variable that is not initialize will give undefined.<br>
           2.If we don't return a function it gives undefined.<br>
           3.If we don't give the parameter value of a function.<br>
           4.If the property doesn't exist in the object it will give undefined.<br>
           5.If we put the array.Index bigger than the index that exist the array, that will give undefined.<br>
           6.set a value directly to undefined.<br>
           7.If we call the delete array index, that will give undefined.<br>
           8.typeof undefined is undefined.<br><br>
           We use null value instead of undefined.

            Que:3-What do you mean by REST API?
        </div>
        <div class="collapse-content"> 
          <p>Ans: <span class="text-[#245481] font-[700]">Rest API-</span>
            A REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and conventions for building and interacting with web services. It is an architectural style for designing networked applications and relies on a stateless, client-server communication protocol, typically HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol). RESTful APIs are widely used for web and mobile application development because they are simple, scalable, and easy to understand.<br><br>
            HTTP Methods: RESTful APIs use HTTP methods to perform actions on resources. The most common HTTP methods used in RESTful APIs are:<br>

GET: Retrieve data from a resource.<br>
POST: Create a new resource.<br>
PUT: Update an existing resource (typically the entire resource).<br>
PATCH: Update a part of an existing resource.<br>
DELETE: Remove a resource.
